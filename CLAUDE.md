# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> Merged from two real, sourced files: the **Karpathy four rules**
> (`multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills` — the mindset layer) and **Boris Cherny's
> operational setup** (`0xquinto/bcherny-claude`, transcribed from his Threads/X tips —
> the mechanics layer). Treat this file as a prompt: keep it terse, delete what goes
> stale, and update it whenever Claude makes a mistake.

## Project

`Dustpan` — a free, open-source, trust-first macOS storage cleaner (SwiftUI, GPL-3.0,
not sandboxed): real measurements or an em-dash, Trash-only deletion behind a safety gate.

---

## Operating principles — the four rules (Karpathy)

Apply these on every task, before and while writing code.

1. **Think Before Coding** — State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
   Surface confusion and tradeoffs; never make a silent decision.
2. **Simplicity First** — Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
   No unnecessary abstractions, no unrequested features.
3. **Surgical Changes** — Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.
   Preserve surrounding style; don't refactor unrelated code unless asked.
4. **Goal-Driven Execution** — Define success criteria, then loop until verified.
   Turn vague tasks into measurable objectives with explicit verification steps.

> Bias toward caution over speed. Success = fewer unnecessary diffs, fewer rewrites from
> overcomplication, and clarifying questions asked *before* implementation.

---

## Workflow (Boris)

### Verification loop — 2–3x quality
1. Make changes  →  2. Typecheck  →  3. Run tests  →  4. Lint  →
5. Before any PR: full lint + test suite. Never commit without tests passing first.

### Plan mode
- Start every complex task in plan mode (shift+tab to cycle). Pour energy into the plan
  so the implementation 1-shots.
- When something goes sideways, switch **back** to plan mode and re-plan. Don't keep
  pushing a bad path.
- Use plan mode for the verification step too, not just the build.

### Auto mode
- Boris's #1 tip: run in **auto mode** (no permission prompts) — cycle with shift+tab
  (default → auto-accept → plan).
- It's the building block for *multi-clauding*: let one session run unattended while you
  work another in parallel.
- Keep guardrails when unattended: scoped allow-lists in `.claude/settings.json`,
  worktrees for isolation, and a `Stop` hook to nudge the session onward.
- Make it sticky via `defaultMode` in `.claude/settings.json`.

### Parallel work
- Offload individual tasks to **subagents** to keep the main context window clean.
- Only one agent edits a given file at a time.
- For fully parallel workstreams use git worktrees:
  `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<name> origin/main`

### Automation & sessions
- `/loop <interval> <skill>` for recurring runs; `/schedule` for cron (up to a week).
  Turn repetitive workflows into skills, then loop them.
- `/branch` (or `claude --resume <id> --fork-session`) to fork; `/btw` for side queries;
  `/teleport` to continue a cloud session locally.
- `--add-dir` / `"additionalDirectories"` in settings.json for multi-repo work.

---

## Code style & conventions

- **TypeScript:** prefer `type` over `interface`; never use `enum` (use string-literal
  unions); never use `any` without explicit approval.
- Descriptive names. Small, focused functions. Tests for new functionality.
- Handle errors explicitly — never swallow them.

## Things Claude should NOT do
- Don't skip error handling or commit without passing tests.
- Don't make breaking API changes without discussion.
- Don't refactor unrelated code while doing something else (see rule 3).
- TODO: append real mistakes here as they happen, so they aren't repeated.

## Commands

```sh
# build (also the typecheck)
xcodebuild -project Dustpan.xcodeproj -scheme Dustpan -configuration Debug build

# empirical engine harness (the test suite until XCTest exists): engines are
# Foundation-only, so compile them with a main.swift of assertions and run it
swiftc -o /tmp/t/run Dustpan/<Engine>.swift Dustpan/SafeDeleteEngine.swift \
  Dustpan/UndoJournal.swift /tmp/t/main.swift && /tmp/t/run
# note: TCC-gated paths (Photos, Mail, Desktop…) read as DENIED from a bare
# harness binary — that's the honest-path behavior, not a bug

# verify a running build (kill stale instances first)
pkill -x Dustpan

# build the CLI (third presentation layer over the same engines; swiftc, no
# xcodeproj target). Universal by default; --thin for a fast host-arch build.
scripts/build-cli.sh            # → dist/dustpan (arm64+x86_64, gitignored)
dist/dustpan help               # scriptable parity: scan/caches/duplicates/…/trash/restore (--json)
```

## Architecture

Two strict layers, one rule: **every number is a real measurement or an em-dash.**

- **Engines** (Foundation-only, no SwiftUI, harness-testable): `SafeDeleteEngine`
  (verdict() safety gate, honest SizeReport with —/≥ denial semantics, Trash-only
  deletion, reclaimable-location scan), `StatsEngine` (20 disjoint disk categories,
  frozen AsyncStream snapshot contract — see its header), `UninstallEngine`
  (apps + leftovers + orphans), `LargeFileEngine`, `ClutterEngine` (installers/
  screenshots, age-sorted), `DuplicateEngine` (size → partial-hash → full-SHA256,
  byte-identical only; hard-link-aware; suggested-keep never pre-selected),
  `LoginItemsEngine` (launchd jobs in plain language, report-only),
  `SnapshotEngine` (tmutil, report-only),
  `DockerReclaimEngine` (Docker/colima/Podman VM disk images; apparent vs
  on-disk allocated size, sparse-gap detection, report-only — pruning never
  shrinks a .raw, so no delete button),
  `DiagnosticsEngine` (Photos/Mail, report-only), `UndoJournal` (JSONL audit log;
  every trash attempt recorded at engine level — call sites can't forget).
- **Views** are presentation-only: they consume app-scoped `@Observable` stores/
  sessions owned by ContentView (`StatsStore`, `ScanSession`, `UninstallSession` —
  scans survive sidebar switches) and only reach engines via `Task.detached`
  read-only report calls. One measurement run feeds Overview, System Data, and
  Disk Map — never a second scan.
- **CLI** (`cli/main.swift`, built by `scripts/build-cli.sh`) is a third
  presentation layer over the same engines — read-only report verbs plus
  `trash`/`restore`, which route through `SafeDeleteEngine.moveToTrash` +
  `UndoJournal` so verdict()-gating and the audit journal hold identically.
  `scan` consumes the same frozen `StatsEngine.live()` AsyncStream the dashboard
  does, so GUI and CLI numbers can't diverge. `--json` for CI/cron.
- **Safety invariants** (don't weaken): all deletion via `SafeDeleteEngine
  .moveToTrash` behind `verdict()` (home-only + one documented /Applications
  uninstall carve-out; root-owned bundles delegate to Finder via Apple Events,
  which shows the macOS admin-auth popup — still Trash-only, the app itself
  never holds elevated rights); denied roots render "—" + permission affordance, never 0;
  `.caution` items are never pre-selected; report-only surfaces (Trash, snapshots,
  Photos/Mail) offer no delete button at all.

## Self-improvement (Boris)

This file is a living prompt, not documentation. After every correction, add a one-line
rule so the mistake isn't repeated — end corrections with *"Now update CLAUDE.md so you
don't make that mistake again."* Keep iterating until the mistake rate measurably drops.
When a line stops mattering, delete it: shorter is better.
